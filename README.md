hi, I'm `void`, you may know me by my brand name `Cooperly`.

I have a little bit of knowledge in C# and Kotlin.

I'm currently working on [Protobit](https://protobit.space) which is a Modded Community Server for the video game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/) with a lot of in-house mods and quality-of-life additions, I've also previously worked on Protobit Minecraft (fka Beeper-MC) but it was shut down due to the project being severely tainted by disgusting behavior from a high-ranking ex-contributor and internal drama/lies.
